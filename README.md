# <ins>NB: THIS APP IS MY FIRST ATTEMPT AT FRONTEND</ins>

``` backend devs get a mac & suddenly think they can tackle js promises (🤹🏿🥁)```
- to be fair its not even a tightly held together app, they are 2 webpages connecting via hrefs and they might as well be on different servers
- the tailwind and particles being used are fetched from cdns, meaning the UX is as nice as your internet speed 
- on campus, for demonstration, if not connected to Liquid Eduzone, use mobile data. 
- use the university network as the last option (CUT WIFI)

  ## HOW TO RUN:
  1. ```git clone https://github.com/lordskyzw/thesocialnetwork```
  2.  ```cd thesocialnetwork```
  3.  ``` code . ```
  4.  If you have live server extension installed in your vscode then "Go Live" on index.html
