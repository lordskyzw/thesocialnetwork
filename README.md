# <ins>NB: THIS APP IS MY FIRST ATTEMPT AT FRONTEND</ins>

- to be fair its not even a tightly held together app, they are 2 webpages connecting via hrefs and they might as well be on different servers
- the tailwind and particles being used are fetched from cdns, meaning the UX is as nice as your internet speed 
- on campus, for demonstration, if not connected to Liquid Eduzone, use mobile data. 
- use the university network as the last option (CUT WIFI)
